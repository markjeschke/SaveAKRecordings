# SaveAKRecordings
Swift Xcode Project that demonstrates how to record, save, and send audio files, via [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/).

## Share your audio with:
1. AudioShare SDK
2. Email Composer
3. Messenger
4. AirDrop
5. iTunes File Sharing

## Instructions:
1. Select an audio format from the segmented controller.
2. Tap the Record button.
3. Tap the "Kick", "Snare", or "Play Song" button options. The "Kick" and "Snare" buttons trigger short samples via AKMidiSamplers, while the "Play Song" button will play a looping m4a AKAudioFile from an AKAudioPlayer.
4. Once you're satisfied with your recording, tap the red Stop button to stop the recording.
5. Tap the green Play to listen to the newly recorded performance.
6. Tap "Show Recordings" to view the recorded audio files. A new file will only be created a show in the Recordings list when you select a different audio format. Otherwise, any new recording will be replaced with the same name and file format extension.
7. Tap "Export Audio Recording" and select an AudioShare, Email, or More option.
8. If you want to delete any of the recordings, you can tap the "Delete All Recordings" button, and and confirm the action.

## Installation:
1. Within Terminal, run `git clone git@github.com:markjeschke/SaveAKRecordings.git` in the command line, or download the [zip](https://github.com/markjeschke/SaveAKRecordings/archive/master.zip) to your local drive.
2. If you have CocoaPods already installed, run `pod install` to install the AudioKit framework.
3. Open the `SaveAKRecording.xcworkspace` source, and build the app to your iPhone or iPad.

### If you don't have CocoaPods installed, please follow these directions:

1. Within Terminal, enter `$ sudo gem install cocoapods` in the command line.
2. Change directory, so that you'll be in the root directory of this "SaveAKRecording" Xcode project. 
3. Run `pod install` to install the pods that are listed in the Podfile.
4. Once the installation has completed, open the project by clicking to open `SaveAKRecording.xcworkspace` â€“ not the `SaveAKRecording.xcodeproj`.

If you're having trouble installing CocoaPods, please refer to their [installation instructions](https://cocoapods.org/#install).

### Note:
You must deploy to an actual device in order to view multiple document files within "Show Recordings."
